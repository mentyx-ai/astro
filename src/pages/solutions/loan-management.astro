        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Which loan types can I service with Mentyx?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Mentyx focuses on private, asset-based real estate loans: fix & flip, bridge, and DSCR. The workflows, fields, and reports are designed around these products, not generic consumer lending.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Do I have to replace my current servicing system on day one?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            No. Many lenders start by using Mentyx for payment tracking, draw management, and alerts while keeping legacy systems for accounting or downstream reporting. You can gradually move more processes into Mentyx as your team gets comfortable.

          <h3 class="faq-question">Can borrowers log in to see their loan status?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes. Borrowers get secure portal access where they can view balances, payment history, next due dates, and draw status. They can also upload documents and submit draw requests, which cuts down on manual email chasing for your team.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How does the system help with taxes and insurance?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            For each loan you track tax and insurance dates, upload bills and certificates, and let the system send automated reminders 60, 30, and 7 days before anything expires or comes due. That reduces the risk of uninsured properties or surprise tax liens.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What reports can I export for investors and auditors?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can export payment histories, aging and delinquency reports, maturity schedules, and portfolio overviews to CSV or PDF. That makes it easy to respond to investor questions or audit requests in minutes instead of days.
