          <p>Stop taking loan applications over the phone or in long email threads. Borrowers enter their own data—cleaner inputs for underwriting, less staff time, and fewer typos in LTV and DSCR calculations.</p>

            An investor tours a fix & flip opportunity at 6pm. Sitting in the car afterward, they open your portal on their phone, enter address, purchase price, rehab budget, and upload a few photos. At home later, they refine the ARV and attach the contractor’s scope on desktop.
            <strong>Application started within 15 minutes of seeing the deal.</strong>

            An experienced investor locks up a small portfolio of rentals on Saturday morning. Your office is closed—but your DSCR application is open. They upload leases, rent rolls, and operating statements from their cloud drive. 
            <strong>By Monday 9am, underwriting has everything needed to size the loan and check DSCR.</strong>

          <h3>The Repeat Borrower</h3>
          <p>
            A repeat borrower logs in, clicks “New Application,” and sees their entity, contact, and experience data already pre-filled. They only update property details, loan amount, and exit strategy.
            <strong>Total time to submit a new bridge loan: under 5 minutes.</strong>

          <h3 class="faq-question">What is a borrower portal for private real estate lending?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            A borrower portal is a secure, online front door where your investors start applications, upload documents, and track loan status in one place. Instead of sending PDFs and email attachments, they move through a guided, mobile-friendly flow that captures clean data for fix &amp; flip, bridge, and DSCR loans.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How does the Mentyx borrower portal improve completion rates?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The portal is built around how investors really work: they can start on a phone at the property, auto-save progress, and finish later on desktop. Clear progress bars, checklists, and real-time validation remove friction, so more borrowers fully complete applications instead of dropping off halfway.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Can the portal be branded with our lending company’s look and feel?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes. Mentyx is fully white-label ready: custom domain, logo, brand colors, and messaging, plus configurable email and SMS templates and legal disclosures. Borrowers experience a seamless journey under your brand from the first click to “Clear to Close.”
